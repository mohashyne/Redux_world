The three building blocks in redux are:

1. Action ( Events ) : functions that return actions.
2. Store
3. Reducer ( Event Handlers ) : reducers are pure functions.


       Dispatch
Action --------> Store --------> Reducer
                 |                  |
                 <------------------|

We don't call the reducer directly, we just work with the store,
the store is in charge of calling the reducer,
the reducer completes thee new state and returns it,
the store will set the state internally,
and then notify the UI component about the update,
the UI component will pullout the update data and re-render itself.

Redux show how actions are Dispatch and how the state has changed.
